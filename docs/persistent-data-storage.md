# Persistent data storage

It could happen when we need to store data without internet connection, and a local DB should be what we need. In this boilerplate I choose [Isar](https://isar.dev) to do the job. If you want to learn about more choices, please check the document: [Database for Flutter APP](https://wiredcraft.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/knowledge/pages/769458611/Database+for+Flutter+APP).

## Isar Demo

The demo is about storing courses and its corresponding teacher and students.

It's basically following this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwC9-a9hJv4&ab_channel=FlutterExplained), but I modified it with Getx.
